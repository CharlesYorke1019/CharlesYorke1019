Hello! My name is Charles Yorke.
The day I'm writing this is June 4th, 2022, meaning I've been coding for roughly 9 months now. 
For the past 9 months I have been learning and using python.
I have numerous certifications in different fields regarding python.
I feel that I know python pretty well, but there is always more to be learned.
I recently just started learning Java, and hope to get a certification in Java. 
All of the files provided in my account are just for fun and practice so enjoy, and if there are any problems are things people recommend I fix just let me know  
If someone needs to contact me, you can do it at charlestanneryorke@gmail.com
